# CSP Solver
Constraint satisfaction problem solver for Sudoku boards

Run:
```
python3 main.py {MODEL1|MODEL2} {PROP_ON|PROP_OFF} {SPLIT_1,SPLIT_2} test2.txt
```

IF YOU WANT TO USE A BIG SUDOKU FILE CONTAINING ALL SUDOKU YOU CAN USE READ_SUDOKU.PY CHANGE THE FILENAME IN THE OPEN COMMAND

MODEL1 - Fills cells by numbers

MODEL2 - Fills numbers by cells
FOR MODEL 2 not all test work

ACHTUNG: IF YOU WANT TO CHECK IF THE MODEL 2 WORKS TAKE FILES OUT OF EXPERIMENTS1

PROP_ON - With propagation heuristic

PROP_OFF - Without propagation heuristic
PROP_OFF takes a long time to compute!!!!!!

SPLIT_1 - Naive splitting

SPLIT_2 - Pick a variable with less domain first

Example:

To run the model 1 with propaation and splitting strategy 1:

```
python3 main.py MODEL1 PROP_ON SPLIT_1 test2.txt
```
